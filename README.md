Vision Transformer for CIFAR-10

# Vision Transformer for CIFAR-10

## Project Summary

This project implements a hybrid Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset, combining convolutional neural networks and transformer techniques to achieve high accuracy.

## Project Overview

The project aims to build a high-performing image classification model by integrating:

- **Hybrid architecture**: A CNN backbone for feature extraction followed by a transformer module for attention modeling.
- **Advanced data augmentation**: Utilizing MixUp, CutMix, and AutoAugment to enhance generalization.
- **Attention visualization**: Analyzing and interpreting model decisions through attention maps.
